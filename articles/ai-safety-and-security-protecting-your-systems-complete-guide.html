<pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">from tensorflowkeraslayers import Input, Dense
from tensorflowkerasmodels import Model
from tensorflowkerasapplications import AdversarialTraining

# Define the input and output layers
input_layer = Input(shape=(784,))
output_layer = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(input_layer)

# Define the adversarial training module
adversarial_training = AdversarialTraining()

# Add the adversarial training to the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
modeladd(adversarial_training)</code></pre>
<h3 class="subsection-header">2.  Explainability Techniques in PyTorch</h3>
<p class="article-paragraph">PyTorch provides a variety of explainability techniques, including feature importance and partial dependence plots.  Here's an example of how to implement feature importance in PyTorch:</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code class="language-python">import torch
from torch import nn
from torchnn import ModuleList

# Define the model
model = nn. Sequential(
    nn. Linear(784, 128),
    nn. ReLU(),
    nn. Linear(128, 10)
)

# Get the feature importance
importance = torchsort(modelparameters(), descending=True)tolist()

# Print the feature importance
print('Feature Importance:', importance)</code></pre>
